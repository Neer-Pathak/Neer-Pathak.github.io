# Neer-Pathak.github.io

Hi, Iâ€™m Neer Pathak â€” a software engineer who enjoys building practical solutions and learning along the way. Outside of work, I like playing badminton, going on treks, and staying active through fitness and clean eating. I try to keep things simple, both in code and in life.
Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my simple website, built with Flutter.
